CVE Number : CVE-2016-2782
Commit Message : 
USB: visor: fix null-deref at probe
Commit Details : 
Fix null-pointer dereference at probe should a (malicious) Treo device
lack the expected endpoints.

Specifically, the Treo port-setup hack was dereferencing the bulk-in and
interrupt-in urbs without first making sure they had been allocated by
core.
