CVE Number : CVE-2017-17856
Commit Message : 
bpf: force strict alignment checks for stack pointers
Commit Details : 
Force strict alignment checks for stack pointers because the tracking of
stack spills relies on it; unaligned stack accesses can lead to corruption
of spilled registers, which is exploitable.

Before patch :

After patch : 
 		break;
 	case PTR_TO_STACK:
 		pointer_desc = "stack ";
 		/* The stack spill tracking logic in check_stack_write()
 		 * and check_stack_read() relies on stack accesses being
