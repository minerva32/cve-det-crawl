CVE Number : CVE-2019-7222
Commit Message : 
KVM: x86: work around leak of uninitialized stack contents (CVE-2019-7222)
Commit Details : 
Bugzilla: 1671930

Emulation of certain instructions (VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, VMWRITE with
memory operand, INVEPT, INVVPID) can incorrectly inject a page fault
when passed an operand that points to an MMIO address.  The page fault
will use uninitialized kernel stack memory as the CR2 and error code.

The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR
exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just
ensure that the error code and CR2 are zero.

Embargoed until Feb 7th 2019.

Before patch : 
 {
 	u32 access = (kvm_x86_ops >get_cpl(vcpu) == 3) ? PFERR_USER_MASK : 0;
 
 	return kvm_read_guest_virt_helper(addr, val, bytes, vcpu, access,
 					  exception);
 }
After patch : 
 {
 	u32 access = (kvm_x86_ops >get_cpl(vcpu) == 3) ? PFERR_USER_MASK : 0;
 
 	/*
 	 * FIXME: this should call handle_emulation_failure if X86EMUL_IO_NEEDED
 	 * is returned, but our callers are not ready for that and they blindly
 	 * call kvm_inject_page_fault.  Ensure that they at least do not leak
 	 * uninitialized kernel stack memory into cr2 and error code.

 	memset(exception, 0, sizeof(*exception));
 	return kvm_read_guest_virt_helper(addr, val, bytes, vcpu, access,
 					  exception);
