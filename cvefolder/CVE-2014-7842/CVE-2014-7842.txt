CVE Number : CVE-2014-7842
Commit Message : 
KVM: x86: Don't report guest userspace emulation error to userspace
Commit Details : 
Commit fc3a9157d314 ("KVM: X86: Don't report L2 emulation failures to
user-space") disabled the reporting of L2 (nested guest) emulation failures to
userspace due to race-condition between a vmexit and the instruction emulator.
The same rational applies also to userspace applications that are permitted by
the guest OS to access MMIO area or perform PIO.

This patch extends the current behavior - of injecting a #UD instead of
reporting it to userspace - also for guest userspace code.

Before patch : 
 
 	  vcpu >stat.insn_emulation_fail;
 	trace_kvm_emulate_insn_failed(vcpu);
 	if (!is_guest_mode(vcpu)) {
 		vcpu >run >exit_reason = KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR;
 		vcpu >run >internal.suberror = KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION;
 		vcpu >run >internal.ndata = 0;
After patch : 
 
 	  vcpu >stat.insn_emulation_fail;
 	trace_kvm_emulate_insn_failed(vcpu);
 	if (!is_guest_mode(vcpu) && kvm_x86_ops >get_cpl(vcpu) == 0) {
 		vcpu >run >exit_reason = KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR;
 		vcpu >run >internal.suberror = KVM_INTERNAL_ERROR_EMULATION;
 		vcpu >run >internal.ndata = 0;
