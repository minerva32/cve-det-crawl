Commit Message : 
KVM: PPC: Book3S: Fix H_RTAS rets buffer overflow
Commit Details : 
The kvmppc_rtas_hcall() sets the host rtas_args.rets pointer based on
the rtas_args.nargs that was provided by the guest. That guest nargs
value is not range checked, so the guest can cause the host rets pointer
to be pointed outside the args array. The individual rtas function
handlers check the nargs and nrets values to ensure they are correct,
but if they are not, the handlers store a -3 (0xfffffffd) failure
indication in rets0 which corrupts host memory.

Fix this by testing up front whether the guest supplied nargs and nret
would exceed the array size, and fail the hcall directly without storing
a failure indication to rets0.

Also expand on a comment about why we kill the guest and try not to
return errors directly if we have a valid rets0 pointer.
