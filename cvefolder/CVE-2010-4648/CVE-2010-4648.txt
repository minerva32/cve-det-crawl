CVE Number : CVE-2010-4648
Commit Message : 
orinoco: fix TKIP countermeasure behaviour
Commit Details : 
Enable the port when disabling countermeasures, and disable it on
enabling countermeasures.

This bug causes the response of the system to certain attacks to be
ineffective.

It also prevents wpa_supplicant from getting scan results, as
wpa_supplicant disables countermeasures on startup - preventing the
hardware from scanning.

wpa_supplicant works with ap_mode=2 despite this bug because the commit
handler re-enables the port.

The log tends to look like:

State: DISCONNECTED -> SCANNING
Starting AP scan for wildcard SSID
Scan requested (ret=0) - scan timeout 5 seconds
EAPOL: disable timer tick
EAPOL: Supplicant port status: Unauthorized
Scan timeout - try to get results
Failed to get scan results
Failed to get scan results - try scanning again
Setting scan request: 1 sec 0 usec
Starting AP scan for wildcard SSID
Scan requested (ret=-1) - scan timeout 5 seconds
Failed to initiate AP scan.
