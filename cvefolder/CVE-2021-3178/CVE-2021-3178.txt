CVE Number : CVE-2021-3178
Commit Message : 
nfsd4: readdirplus shouldn't return parent of export
Commit Details : 
If you export a subdirectory of a filesystem, a READDIRPLUS on the root
of that export will return the filehandle of the parent with the ".."
entry.

The filehandle is optional, so let's just not return the filehandle for
".." if we're at the root of an export.

Note that once the client learns one filehandle outside of the export,
they can trivially access the rest of the export using further lookups.

However, it is also not very difficult to guess filehandles outside of
the export.  So exporting a subdirectory of a filesystem should
considered equivalent to providing access to the entire filesystem.  To
avoid confusion, we recommend only exporting entire filesystems.

Before patch : 
 	if (isdotent(name, namlen)) {
 		if (namlen == 2) {
 			dchild = dget_parent(dparent);
 			/* filesystem root   cannot return filehandle for ".." */
 			if (dchild == dparent)
 				goto out;
 		} else
 			dchild = dget(dparent);
 	} else
After patch : 
 	if (isdotent(name, namlen)) {
 		if (namlen == 2) {
 			dchild = dget_parent(dparent);
 			/*
 			 * Don't return filehandle for ".." if we're at
 			 * the filesystem or export root:
 			 */
 			if (dchild == dparent)
 				goto out;
 			if (dparent == exp >ex_path.dentry)
 				goto out;
 		} else
 			dchild = dget(dparent);
 	} else
