CVE Number : CVE-2019-12379
Commit Message : 
Revert "consolemap: Fix a memory leaking bug in drivers/tty/vt/consolemap.c"
Commit Details : 
This reverts commit 84ecc2f6eb1cb12e6d44818f94fa49b50f06e6ac.

con_insert_unipair() is working with a sparse 3-dimensional array:

- p->uni_pgdir is the top layer
- p1 points to a middle layer
- p2 points to a bottom layer

If it needs to allocate a new middle layer, and then fails to allocate
a new bottom layer, it would previously free only p2, and now it frees
both p1 and p2.  But since the new middle layer was already registered
in the top layer, it was not leaked.

However, if it looks up an *existing* middle layer and then fails to
allocate a bottom layer, it now frees both p1 and p2 but does *not*
free any other bottom layers under p1.  So it *introduces* a memory
leak.

The error path also cleared the wrong index in p->uni_pgdir,
introducing a use-after-free.

Before patch : 
 	p2 = p1[n = (unicode >> 6) & 0x1f];
 	if (!p2) {
 		p2 = p1[n] = kmalloc_array(64, sizeof(u16), GFP_KERNEL);
 		if (!p2) {
 			kfree(p1);
 			p >uni_pgdir[n] = NULL;
 			return  ENOMEM;
 		}
 		memset(p2, 0xff, 64*sizeof(u16)); /* No glyphs for the characters (yet) */
 	}
 
After patch : 
 	p2 = p1[n = (unicode >> 6) & 0x1f];
 	if (!p2) {
 		p2 = p1[n] = kmalloc_array(64, sizeof(u16), GFP_KERNEL);
 		if (!p2) return  ENOMEM;
 		memset(p2, 0xff, 64*sizeof(u16)); /* No glyphs for the characters (yet) */
 	}
