CVE Number : CVE-2010-4082
Commit Message : 
drivers/video/via/ioctl.c: prevent reading uninitialized stack memory
Commit Details : 
The VIAFB_GET_INFO device ioctl allows unprivileged users to read 246
bytes of uninitialized stack memory, because the "reserved" member of
the viafb_ioctl_info struct declared on the stack is not altered or
zeroed before being copied back to the user.  This patch takes care of
it.

Before patch : 
 {
 	struct viafb_ioctl_info viainfo;
 
 	viainfo.viafb_id = VIAID;
 	viainfo.vendor_id = PCI_VIA_VENDOR_ID;
 
After patch : 
 {
 	struct viafb_ioctl_info viainfo;
 
 	memset(&viainfo, 0, sizeof(struct viafb_ioctl_info));
 
 	viainfo.viafb_id = VIAID;
 	viainfo.vendor_id = PCI_VIA_VENDOR_ID;
