CVE Number : CVE-2013-3229
Commit Message : 
iucv: Fix missing msg_namelen update in iucv_sock_recvmsg()
Commit Details : 
The current code does not fill the msg_name member in case it is set.
It also does not set the msg_namelen member to 0 and therefore makes
net/socket.c leak the local, uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable
to userland -- 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.

Fix that by simply setting msg_namelen to 0 as obviously nobody cared
about iucv_sock_recvmsg() not filling the msg_name in case it was set.

Before patch : 
 	struct sk_buff *skb, *rskb, *cskb;
 	int err = 0;
 
 	if ((sk >sk_state == IUCV_DISCONN) &&
 	    skb_queue_empty(&iucv >backlog_skb_q) &&
 	    skb_queue_empty(&sk >sk_receive_queue) &&
After patch : 
 	struct sk_buff *skb, *rskb, *cskb;
 	int err = 0;
 
 	msg >msg_namelen = 0;
 
 	if ((sk >sk_state == IUCV_DISCONN) &&
 	    skb_queue_empty(&iucv >backlog_skb_q) &&
 	    skb_queue_empty(&sk >sk_receive_queue) &&
