CVE Number : CVE-2021-3347
Commit Message : 
futex: Replace pointless printk in fixup_owner()
Commit Details : 
If that unexpected case of inconsistent arguments ever happens then the
futex state is left completely inconsistent and the printk is not really
helpful. Replace it with a warning and make the state consistent.

Before patch : 
 
 	/*
 	 * Paranoia check. If we did not take the lock, then we should not be
 	 * the owner of the rt_mutex.
 	 */
 	if (rt_mutex_owner(&q >pi_state >pi_mutex) == current) {
 		printk(KERN_ERR "fixup_owner: ret = %d pi mutex: %p "
 				"pi state %p\n", ret,
 				q >pi_state >pi_mutex.owner,
 				q >pi_state >owner);
 	}
 
 	return 0;
 }
After patch : 
 
 	/*
 	 * Paranoia check. If we did not take the lock, then we should not be
 	 * the owner of the rt_mutex. Warn and establish consistent state.
 	 */
 	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(rt_mutex_owner(&q >pi_state >pi_mutex) == current))
 		return fixup_pi_state_owner(uaddr, q, current);
 
 	return 0;
 }
