CVE Number : CVE-2015-5364
Commit Message : 
udp: fix behavior of wrong checksums
Commit Details : 
We have two problems in UDP stack related to bogus checksums :

1) We return -EAGAIN to application even if receive queue is not empty.
   This breaks applications using edge trigger epoll()

2) Under UDP flood, we can loop forever without yielding to other
   processes, potentially hanging the host, especially on non SMP.

This patch is an attempt to make things better.

We might in the future add extra support for rt applications
wanting to better control time spent doing a recv() in a hostile
environment. For example we could validate checksums before queuing
packets in socket receive queue.

Before patch : 
 	}
 	unlock_sock_fast(sk, slow);
 
 	if (noblock)
 		return  EAGAIN;
 
 	/* starting over for a new packet */
 	msg >msg_flags &= ~MSG_TRUNC;
 	goto try_again;
 }
 	}
 	unlock_sock_fast(sk, slow);
 
 	if (noblock)
 		return  EAGAIN;
 
 	/* starting over for a new packet */
 	msg >msg_flags &= ~MSG_TRUNC;
 	goto try_again;
 }
After patch : 
 	}
 	unlock_sock_fast(sk, slow);
 
 	/* starting over for a new packet, but check if we need to yield */
 	cond_resched();
 	msg >msg_flags &= ~MSG_TRUNC;
 	goto try_again;
 }
 	}
 	unlock_sock_fast(sk, slow);
 
 	/* starting over for a new packet, but check if we need to yield */
 	cond_resched();
 	msg >msg_flags &= ~MSG_TRUNC;
 	goto try_again;
 }
