CVE Number : CVE-2013-3231
Commit Message : 
llc: Fix missing msg_namelen update in llc_ui_recvmsg()
Commit Details : 
For stream sockets the code misses to update the msg_namelen member
to 0 and therefore makes net/socket.c leak the local, uninitialized
sockaddr_storage variable to userland -- 128 bytes of kernel stack
memory. The msg_namelen update is also missing for datagram sockets
in case the socket is shutting down during receive.

Fix both issues by setting msg_namelen to 0 early. It will be
updated later if we're going to fill the msg_name member.

Before patch : 
 	int target;	/* Read at least this many bytes */
 	long timeo;
 
 	lock_sock(sk);
 	copied =  ENOTCONN;
 	if (unlikely(sk >sk_type == SOCK_STREAM && sk >sk_state == TCP_LISTEN))
After patch : 
 	int target;	/* Read at least this many bytes */
 	long timeo;
 
 	msg >msg_namelen = 0;
 
 	lock_sock(sk);
 	copied =  ENOTCONN;
 	if (unlikely(sk >sk_type == SOCK_STREAM && sk >sk_state == TCP_LISTEN))
