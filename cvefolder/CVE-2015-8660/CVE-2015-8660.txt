CVE Number : CVE-2015-8660
Commit Message : 
ovl: fix permission checking for setattr
Commit Details : 
Al Viro The bug is in being too enthusiastic about optimizing ->setattr()
away - instead of "copy verbatim with metadata" + "chmod/chown/utimes"
(with the former being always safe and the latter failing in case of
insufficient permissions) it tries to combine these two.  Note that copyup
itself will have to do ->setattr() anyway; _that_ is where the elevated
capabilities are right.  Having these two ->setattr() (one to set verbatim
copy of metadata, another to do what overlayfs ->setattr() had been asked
to do in the first place) combined is where it breaks.
