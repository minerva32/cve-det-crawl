CVE Number : CVE-2020-16119
Commit Message : 
UBUNTU: SAUCE: dccp: avoid double free of ccid on child socket
Commit Details : 
When a dccp socket is cloned, the pointers to dccps_hc_rx_ccid and
dccps_hc_tx_ccid are copied. When CCID features are activated on the child
socket, the CCID objects are freed, leaving the parent socket with dangling
pointers.

During cloning, set dccps_hc_rx_ccid and dccps_hc_tx_ccid to NULL so the
parent objects are not freed.
