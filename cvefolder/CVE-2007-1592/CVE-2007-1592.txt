CVE Number : CVE-2007-1592
Commit Message : 
IPV6: ipv6_fl_socklist is inadvertently shared.
Commit Details : 
The ipv6_fl_socklist from listening socket is inadvertently shared
with new socket created for connection.  This leads to a variety of
interesting, but fatal, bugs. For example, removing one of the
sockets may lead to the other socket's encountering a page fault
when the now freed list is referenced.

The fix is to not share the flow label list with the new socket.
