CVE Number : CVE-2019-19534
Commit Message : 
can: peak_usb: fix slab info leak
Commit Details : 
Fix a small slab info leak due to a failure to clear the command buffer
at allocation.

The first 16 bytes of the command buffer are always sent to the device
in pcan_usb_send_cmd() even though only the first two may have been
initialised in case no argument payload is provided (e.g. when waiting
for a response).

Before patch : 
 	dev = netdev_priv(netdev);
 
 	/* allocate a buffer large enough to send commands */
 	dev >cmd_buf = kmalloc(PCAN_USB_MAX_CMD_LEN, GFP_KERNEL);
 	if (!dev >cmd_buf) {
 		err =  ENOMEM;
 		goto lbl_free_candev;
After patch : 
 	dev = netdev_priv(netdev);
 
 	/* allocate a buffer large enough to send commands */
 	dev >cmd_buf = kzalloc(PCAN_USB_MAX_CMD_LEN, GFP_KERNEL);
 	if (!dev >cmd_buf) {
 		err =  ENOMEM;
 		goto lbl_free_candev;
