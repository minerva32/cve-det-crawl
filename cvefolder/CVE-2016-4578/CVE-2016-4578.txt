Before patch : 
 		tu >tstamp = *tstamp;
 	if ((tu >filter & (1 << event)) == 0 || !tu >tread)
 		return;
 	r1.event = event;
 	r1.tstamp = *tstamp;
 	r1.val = resolution;
After patch : 
 		tu >tstamp = *tstamp;
 	if ((tu >filter & (1 << event)) == 0 || !tu >tread)
 		return;
 	memset(&r1, 0, sizeof(r1));
 	r1.event = event;
 	r1.tstamp = *tstamp;
 	r1.val = resolution;
