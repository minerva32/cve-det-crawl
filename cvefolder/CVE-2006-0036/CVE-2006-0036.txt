CVE Number : CVE-2006-0036
Commit Message : 
NETFILTER: Fix crash in ip_nat_pptp

When an inbound PPTP_IN_CALL_REQUEST packet is received the
PPTP NAT helper uses a NULL pointer in pointer arithmentic to
calculate the offset in the packet which needs to be mangled
and corrupts random memory or crashes.
