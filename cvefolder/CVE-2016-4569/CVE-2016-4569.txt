padding bytes are sent to user without being initialized.

Before patch : 
 	if (tu >timeri >flags & SNDRV_TIMER_IFLG_EARLY_EVENT) {
 		if (tu >tread) {
 			struct snd_timer_tread tread;
 			tread.event = SNDRV_TIMER_EVENT_EARLY;
 			tread.tstamp.tv_sec = 0;
 			tread.tstamp.tv_nsec = 0;
After patch : 
 	if (tu >timeri >flags & SNDRV_TIMER_IFLG_EARLY_EVENT) {
 		if (tu >tread) {
 			struct snd_timer_tread tread;
 			memset(&tread, 0, sizeof(tread));
 			tread.event = SNDRV_TIMER_EVENT_EARLY;
 			tread.tstamp.tv_sec = 0;
 			tread.tstamp.tv_nsec = 0;
