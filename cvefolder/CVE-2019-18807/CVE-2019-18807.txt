Commit Message : 
net: dsa: sja1105: Prevent leaking memory
Commit Details : 
In sja1105_static_config_upload, in two cases memory is leaked: when
static_config_buf_prepare_for_upload fails and when sja1105_inhibit_tx
fails. In both cases config_buf should be released.

Fixes: 1a4c69406cc1 ("net: dsa: sja1105: Prevent PHY jabbering during switch reset")

Before patch : 
 	rc = static_config_buf_prepare_for_upload(priv, config_buf, buf_len);
 	if (rc < 0) {
 		dev_err(dev, "Invalid config, cannot upload\n");
 		return  EINVAL;
 	}
 	/* Prevent PHY jabbering during switch reset by inhibiting
 	 * Tx on all ports and waiting for current packet to drain.
 	rc = sja1105_inhibit_tx(priv, port_bitmap, true);
 	if (rc < 0) {
 		dev_err(dev, "Failed to inhibit Tx on ports\n");
 		return  ENXIO;
 	}
 	/* Wait for an eventual egress packet to finish transmission
 	 * (reach IFG). It is guaranteed that a second one will not
