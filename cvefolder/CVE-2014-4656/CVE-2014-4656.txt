CVE Number : CVE-2014-4656
Commit Message : 
ALSA: control: Make sure that id->index does not overflow
Commit Details : 
The ALSA control code expects that the range of assigned indices to a control is
continuous and does not overflow. Currently there are no checks to enforce this.
If a control with a overflowing index range is created that control becomes
effectively inaccessible and unremovable since snd_ctl_find_id() will not be
able to find it. This patch adds a check that makes sure that controls with a
overflowing index range can not be created.

Before patch : 
 	if (snd_BUG_ON(!card || !kcontrol >info))
 		goto error;
 	id = kcontrol >id;
 	down_write(&card >controls_rwsem);
 	if (snd_ctl_find_id(card, &id)) {
 		up_write(&card >controls_rwsem);
After patch : 
 	if (snd_BUG_ON(!card || !kcontrol >info))
 		goto error;
 	id = kcontrol >id;
 	if (id.index > UINT_MAX   kcontrol >count)
 		goto error;
 
 	down_write(&card >controls_rwsem);
 	if (snd_ctl_find_id(card, &id)) {
 		up_write(&card >controls_rwsem);
