CVE Number : CVE-2006-0096
Commit Message : 
PATCH SDLA firmware upgrade should require CAP_SYS_RAWIO (not just CAP_NET_ADMIN)
Commit Details : 
There were a few variants on the list trying to work out what the valid
ranges to verify for write are but they sort of missed the point, if you
can load new firmware you can have fun anyway.

Before patch : 
 
 		case SDLA_WRITEMEM:
 		case SDLA_READMEM:
 			return(sdla_xfer(dev, ifr >ifr_data, cmd == SDLA_READMEM));
 
 		case SDLA_START:
After patch : 
 
 		case SDLA_WRITEMEM:
 		case SDLA_READMEM:
 			if(!capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO))
 				return  EPERM;
 			return(sdla_xfer(dev, ifr >ifr_data, cmd == SDLA_READMEM));
 
 		case SDLA_START:
