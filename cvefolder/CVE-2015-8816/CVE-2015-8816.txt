CVE Number : CVE-2015-8816
Commit Message : 
USB: fix invalid memory access in hub_activate()
Commit Details : 
Commit 8520f38099cc ("USB: change hub initialization sleeps to
delayed_work") changed the hub_activate() routine to make part of it
run in a workqueue.  However, the commit failed to take a reference to
the usb_hub structure or to lock the hub interface while doing so.  As
a result, if a hub is plugged in and quickly unplugged before the work
routine can run, the routine will try to access memory that has been
deallocated.  Or, if the hub is unplugged while the routine is
running, the memory may be deallocated while it is in active use.

This patch fixes the problem by taking a reference to the usb_hub at
the start of hub_activate() and releasing it at the end (when the work
is finished), and by locking the hub interface while the work routine
is running.  It also adds a check at the start of the routine to see
if the hub has already been disconnected, in which nothing should be
done.

Before patch : 
 	unsigned delay;
 
 	/* Continue a partial initialization */
 	if (type == HUB_INIT2)
 		goto init2;
 	if (type == HUB_INIT3)
 		goto init3;
 
 	/* The superspeed hub except for root hub has to use Hub Depth
 	 * value as an offset into the route string to locate the bits
 			queue_delayed_work(system_power_efficient_wq,
 					&hub >init_work,
 					msecs_to_jiffies(delay));
 			return;		/* Continues at init3: below */
 		} else {
 			msleep(delay);
 	/* Allow autosuspend if it was suppressed */
 	if (type <= HUB_INIT3)
 		usb_autopm_put_interface_async(to_usb_interface(hub >intfdev));
 }
 
 /* Implement the continuations for the delays above */
After patch : 
 	unsigned delay;
 
 	/* Continue a partial initialization */
 	if (type == HUB_INIT2 || type == HUB_INIT3) {
 		device_lock(hub >intfdev);
 
 		/* Was the hub disconnected while we were waiting? */
 		if (hub >disconnected) {
 			device_unlock(hub >intfdev);
 			kref_put(&hub >kref, hub_release);
 			return;
 		}
 		if (type == HUB_INIT2)
 			goto init2;
 		goto init3;
 	}
 	kref_get(&hub >kref);
 
 	/* The superspeed hub except for root hub has to use Hub Depth
 	 * value as an offset into the route string to locate the bits
 			queue_delayed_work(system_power_efficient_wq,
 					&hub >init_work,
 					msecs_to_jiffies(delay));
 			device_unlock(hub >intfdev);
 			return;		/* Continues at init3: below */
 		} else {
 			msleep(delay);
 	/* Allow autosuspend if it was suppressed */
 	if (type <= HUB_INIT3)
 		usb_autopm_put_interface_async(to_usb_interface(hub >intfdev));
 
 	if (type == HUB_INIT2 || type == HUB_INIT3)
 		device_unlock(hub >intfdev);
 
 	kref_put(&hub >kref, hub_release);
 }
 
 /* Implement the continuations for the delays above */
