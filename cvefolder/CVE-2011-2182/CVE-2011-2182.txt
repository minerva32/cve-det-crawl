CVE Number : CVE-2011-2182
Commit Message : 
Fix for buffer overflow in ldm_frag_add not sufficient
Commit Details : 
As Ben Hutchings discovered 1, the patch for CVE-2011-1017 (buffer
overflow in ldm_frag_add) is not sufficient.  The original patch in
commit c340b1d64000 ("fs/partitions/ldm.c: fix oops caused by corrupted
partition table") does not consider that, for subsequent fragments,
previously allocated memory is used.

Before patch : 
 
 	list_add_tail (&f >list, frags);
 found:
 	if (f >map & (1 << rec)) {
 		ldm_error ("Duplicate VBLK, part %d.", rec);
 		f >map &= 0x7F;			/* Mark the group as broken */
After patch : 
 
 	list_add_tail (&f >list, frags);
 found:
 	if (rec >= f >num) {
 		ldm_error("REC value (%d) exceeds NUM value (%d)", rec, f >num);
 		return false;
 	}
 
 	if (f >map & (1 << rec)) {
 		ldm_error ("Duplicate VBLK, part %d.", rec);
 		f >map &= 0x7F;			/* Mark the group as broken */
