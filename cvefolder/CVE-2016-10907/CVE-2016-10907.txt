CVE Number : CVE-2016-10907
Commit Message : 
iio: ad5755: fix off-by-one on devnr limit check
Commit Details : 
The comparison for devnr limits is off-by-one, the current check
allows 0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS and the limit should be in fact
0 to AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS - 1.  This can lead to an out of bounds
write to pdata->dacdevnr. Fix this by replacing > with >= on the
comparison.

Before patch : 
 
 	devnr = 0;
 	for_each_child_of_node(np, pp) {
 		if (devnr > AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS) {
 			dev_err(dev,
 				"There is to many channels defined in DT\n");
 			goto error_out;
After patch : 
 
 	devnr = 0;
 	for_each_child_of_node(np, pp) {
 		if (devnr >= AD5755_NUM_CHANNELS) {
 			dev_err(dev,
 				"There is to many channels defined in DT\n");
 			goto error_out;
