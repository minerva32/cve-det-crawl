CVE Number : CVE-2014-3183
Commit Message : 
HID: logitech: fix bounds checking on LED report size
Commit Details : 
The check on report size for REPORT_TYPE_LEDS in logi_dj_ll_raw_request()
is wrong; the current check doesn't make any sense -- the report allocated
by HID core in hid_hw_raw_request() can be much larger than
DJREPORT_SHORT_LENGTH, and currently logi_dj_ll_raw_request() doesn't
handle this properly at all.

Fix the check by actually trimming down the report size properly if it is
too large.

Before patch : 
 	if (!out_buf)
 		return  ENOMEM;
 
 	if (count < DJREPORT_SHORT_LENGTH   2)
 		count = DJREPORT_SHORT_LENGTH   2;
 
 	out_buf[0] = REPORT_ID_DJ_SHORT;
After patch : 
 	if (!out_buf)
 		return  ENOMEM;
 
 	if (count > DJREPORT_SHORT_LENGTH   2)
 		count = DJREPORT_SHORT_LENGTH   2;
 
 	out_buf[0] = REPORT_ID_DJ_SHORT;
