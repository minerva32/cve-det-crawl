CVE Number : CVE-2015-5707
Commit Message : 
sg_start_req(): make sure that there's not too many elements in iovec
Commit Details : 
unfortunately, allowing an arbitrary 16bit value means a possibility of
overflow in the calculation of total number of pages in bio_map_user_iov() -
we rely on there being no more than PAGE_SIZE members of sum in the
first loop there.  If that sum wraps around, we end up allocating
too small array of pointers to pages and it's easy to overflow it in
the second loop.

X-Coverup: TINC (and there's no lumber cartel either)

Before patch : 
 			md >from_user = 0;
 	}
 
 	if (iov_count) {
 		int size = sizeof(struct iovec) * iov_count;
 		struct iovec *iov;
After patch : 
 			md >from_user = 0;
 	}
 
 	if (unlikely(iov_count > MAX_UIOVEC))
 		return  EINVAL;
 
 	if (iov_count) {
 		int size = sizeof(struct iovec) * iov_count;
 		struct iovec *iov;
