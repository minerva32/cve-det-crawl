CVE Number : CVE-2018-21008
Commit Message : 
rsi: add fix for crash during assertions
Commit Details : 
Observed crash in some scenarios when assertion has occurred,
this is because hw structure is freed and is tried to get
accessed in some functions where null check is already
present. So, avoided the crash by making the hw to NULL after
freeing.
