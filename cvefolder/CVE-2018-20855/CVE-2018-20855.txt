Before patch : 
 	struct mlx5_ib_resources *devr = &dev >devr;
 	int inlen = MLX5_ST_SZ_BYTES(create_qp_in);
 	struct mlx5_core_dev *mdev = dev >mdev;
 	struct mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp resp;
 	struct mlx5_ib_cq *send_cq;
 	struct mlx5_ib_cq *recv_cq;
 	unsigned long flags;
After patch : 
 	struct mlx5_ib_resources *devr = &dev >devr;
 	int inlen = MLX5_ST_SZ_BYTES(create_qp_in);
 	struct mlx5_core_dev *mdev = dev >mdev;
 	struct mlx5_ib_create_qp_resp resp = {};
 	struct mlx5_ib_cq *send_cq;
 	struct mlx5_ib_cq *recv_cq;
 	unsigned long flags;
