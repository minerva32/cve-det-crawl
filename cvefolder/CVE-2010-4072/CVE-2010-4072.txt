Before patch : 
 	    {
 		struct shmid_ds out;
 
 		ipc64_perm_to_ipc_perm(&in >shm_perm, &out.shm_perm);
 		out.shm_segsz	= in >shm_segsz;
 		out.shm_atime	= in >shm_atime;
After patch : 
 	    {
 		struct shmid_ds out;
 
 		memset(&out, 0, sizeof(out));
 		ipc64_perm_to_ipc_perm(&in >shm_perm, &out.shm_perm);
 		out.shm_segsz	= in >shm_segsz;
 		out.shm_atime	= in >shm_atime;
